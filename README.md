# BellaDati SDK Tutorial

This repository contains the source code used by the BellaDati SDK blog tutorials.

Each tutorial step is available in a separate branch. The master branch contains the code from the latest tutorial step but may contain changes made since then.

## Requirements

[Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) is required to build the project and download dependencies. Maven is included in most Eclipse for Java distributions.

[Eclipse for Java EE](http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/keplersr2) is recommended to explore and work with the project source. It is not required to build the project.

## Build Instructions

Clone the repository and check out the desired branch. You can build the project WAR file by running `mvn install` in the project directory.

Alternatively you can import the repository contents into Eclipse and build or deploy the project from there.
